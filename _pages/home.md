The Quality AI lab (QuAIL) is an artificial intelligence research lab that is part of XBOX Studios at Microsoft. QuAIL has a mission of developing and applying AI research for game inspection and quality assurance. The game development industry faces challenges in monitoring game inspection and quality assurance activities due to the continuously evolving complexity of games. We aim to augment human-based game quality assurance efforts using AI methods to increase their effectiveness and scale.


There are three main research themes at QuAIL:

1. **AI agents for game exploration and inspection**: Solving sequential decision making problems for game space exploration and inspection using deep reinforcement learning agents.
2. **Vidual bug detection in video games**: Researching novel computer vision methods for visual bug/anomaly detection in video games.
3. **Game scene understanding**: Developing visual-language models for game scene understanding and representation learning. 


### Technologies and methods
QuAIL utilizes and contributes to methods from relevant state-of-the-art AI and machine learning literature on deep reinforcement learning, computer vision, and natural language processing.

### Collaborators
We work closely with numerous collaborators, including engineering and quality assurance teams within Studios Quality, game development teams in XBOX game studios, and researchers from Microsoft research (MSR) Asia.
