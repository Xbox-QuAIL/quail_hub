## Understanding the role of ASD genes
<div style="text-align: justify">
The genes discovered through exome sequencing provide an entree into the biology of ASD, hopefully as a foundation for developing theraputics. The Sanders Lab takes two research approaches: 1) To consider ASD-associated genes en masse to look for patterns of convergence [State MW, Šestan N Science 2012](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22984058); 2) To investigate the genes with the strongest evidence of ASD association, such as SCN2A in depth.

Through the first approach, the Sanders Lab has helped delineate two major functional roles of ASD-associated genes: 1) gene expression regulators (GER), i.e. genes that influence the expression of other genes such as CHD8 and ARID1B; and 2) neuronal communication, such as SCN2A and NRXN1, see [De Rubeis et al. Nature 2014](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25363760) and [Sanders et al. Neuron 2015](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26402605). Co-expression analysis showed convergence across multiple ASD-associated genes during mid-fetal development in the prefrontal cortex and this result was driven by layer 5/6 glutamatergic neurons ([Willsey et al. Cell 2015](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24267886)). Similar patterns have been identified through other systems-based approaches, reviewed in [Sanders Curr Opin Genet Dev 2015](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26547130).

The second approach has focused mainly on the gene SCN2A and is performed in collaboration with the [Bender lab at UCSF](https://benderlab.ucsf.edu/research-projects), the [SCN2A family group](http://www.scn2a.org), and [Simons VIP](https://simonsvipconnect.org). By integrating genetic data across multiple cases and cohorts with structural data on the NaV1.2 protein encoded by SCN2A and electrophysiology, we demonstrated that loss-of-function mutations of SCN2A lead to ASD and developmental delay, while gain-of-function mutations lead to epileptic encephalopathy ([Ben-Shalom et al. 2017](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28256214)).

## Copy number variants (CNVs) in autism spectrum 
<div style="text-align: justify">
My early publications describe the development of a novel approach to detecting de novo CNVs in Illumina SNP genotyping data and applying this to Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) families from the Simons Simplex Collection (SSC). While de novo CNVs had previously been associated with ASD (Sebat et al. 2007), our analysis of this cohort of 1,124 families, including unaffected siblings, allowed us to clarify the genomic architecture. In turn, this allowed us to develop a statistical approach to evaluating whether specific genomic loci are associated with ASD; four de novo duplications at 7q11.23 met these criteria for ASD association with reduced sociability and, notably, deletions at the same locus are associated with increased social behavior in William’s Syndrome. We have recently (2015) published a CNV analysis of all 2,591 families in the SSC. By integrating CNV and exome data we showed that small de novo deletions contain one critical ASD gene, while large de novo CNVs contain multiple ASD risk genes. We use this finding to identify six ASD risk CNV loci and 65 ASD risk genes. I led the analysis and write up of both projects including the development of novel approaches to CNV detection. Autism Speaks cited our 2011 CNV analysis as one of the top Ten Autism Research Achievements.
