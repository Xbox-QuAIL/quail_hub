## Gene discovery in autism spectrum disorder and other developmental disorders
<div style="text-align: justify">
Exome sequencing has revolutionized our ability to find the genes associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and other severe developmental disorders. Four papers, published concurrently in 2012, showed an excess of de novo mutations that disrupt genes in cases compared to controls and Dr. Sanders, working in Dr. State's lab at Yale, was the first author of one of these ([Sanders et al. Nature 2012](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22495306)). This paper also demonstrated that observing disruptive de novo mutations in the same gene across multiple cases could be used to establish genome-wide association with ASD, and this method was used to identify the voltage-gated sodium channel SCN2A as one of the most frequent causes of ASD. As a member of the [Autism Sequencing Consortium](https://genome.emory.edu/ASC/), the Sanders Lab continues to play an active role in advancing gene discovery in ASD. The initial observation of an excess of disruptive de novo mutations in cases has been replicated in larger cohorts (e.g. [De Rubeis et al. Nature 2014](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25363760), [Iossifov et al. Nature 2014](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25363768), [Dong et al. 2014](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25284784)). These two cohorts were combined and integrated with copy number variant (CNV) data to identify 65 genes associated with ASD ([Sanders et al. Neuron 2015](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26402605)). This approach to gene discovery has been successful in several other developmental disorders, including severe developmental delay, epileptic encephalopathy, and congenital heart disease.

This is an inline equation: $$V_{sphere} = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3$$,<br>
followed by a display style equation:

$$V_{sphere} = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3$$

The following is an example for a numbered equation:

$$
\begin{align}
  \tag{1.1}
  V_{sphere} = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3 \label{eq:test1}
\end{align}
$$

In Eq. $\eqref{eq:test1}$ you can see

The following are tables
