### Overview
Wei is working on computer vision research for visual bug detection in AAA gaming. She acquired her Ph.D. degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the Northeastern University, Boston, US, in 2017. Her Ph.D. thesis was temporal-spectral characterization and classification of marine mammal vocalizations and ship-radiated sound over continental shelf scale regions with coherent hydrophone array measurements. Besides, she participated in multiple funded research projects during her Ph.D., including developing machine learning models for acoustic sound classification, sound source identification and localization using acoustic data from sensor array system. Before wei joined QUAIL, she worked as research scientist at industrial AI lab in Hitachi America, where she mainly focused on developing machine learning and deep learning algorithms for predictive maintenance applications in real industry.
