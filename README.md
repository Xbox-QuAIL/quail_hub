# XBOX Quality AI (QuAIL) HUB
![Alt text](images/QuAIL_Logo.png)

A website source for QuAIL group, works, and news.

Our website is based on the open source templates designed and shared by the labs of [D. Allan Drummond](http://www.allanlab.org/aboutwebsite.html) and [Trevor Bedford](http://bedford.io/misc/about/). We followd the [Sanders Lab](https://github.com/sanderslab/sanderslab.github.io) template, which is a derivative of the original templates.
